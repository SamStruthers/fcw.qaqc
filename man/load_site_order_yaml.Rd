\title{Load site order definitions from a YAML file}
\usage{
load_site_order_yaml(yaml_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{yaml_path}{Path to a YAML file containing site relationships.}
}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a site and contains
a character vector of that site's upstream, self, and downstream neighbors.
}
\description{
Reads a YAML file that defines upstream and downstream relationships
for each site and returns a named list of site order vectors.

Each site entry in the YAML file should have two keys:
\itemize{
\item \code{upstream}: the immediate upstream site name, or an empty string "" if none
\item \code{downstream}: the immediate downstream site name, or an empty string "" if none
}

For each site, this function constructs a vector containing the upstream site
(if defined), the site itself, and the downstream site (if defined).

#' # Example YAML file format:
sites:
top_site_name:
upstream: ""
downstream: down_one_site_name

down_one_site_name:
upstream: top_site_name
downstream: bottom_site_name

bottom_site_name:
upstream: down_one_site_name
downstream: ""

disconnected_site:
upstream: ""
downstream: ""

Expected Outputs:
site_order_list <- load_site_order_yaml("site_orders.yaml")
site_order_list$down_one_site_name
#> \link{1} "top_site_name" "down_one_site_name" "bottom_site_name"

site_order_list$disconnected_site
#> \link{1} "disconnected_site"
