\title{Reduce overflagging by comparing across monitoring network}
\usage{
network_check(df, network = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A site-parameter dataframe that has undergone initial flagging. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}: Standardized site name
\item \code{parameter}: The measurement type
\item \code{DT_round}: Timestamp for measurements
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags
}}

\item{network}{Character string specifying the monitoring network to use for site
relationships. Options are "all" (default), "CSU", or "FCW" (case-insensitive).}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, plus an \code{auto_flag} column
that contains cleaned flags where network-wide events have been accounted for.
}
\description{
Identifies and corrects overflagging by comparing data patterns across upstream
and downstream monitoring sites. When quality flags at a site coincide with similar
patterns at neighboring sites, these flags are often indicating real water quality
events rather than sensor malfunctions and can be removed.

Different site configurations are handled based on the monitoring network specified.
For chlorophyll measurements in the FCW/CSU network, no changes are made as these
measurements are site-specific.
