\title{Flag measurements when sonde was not fully submerged}
\usage{
add_unsubmerged_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing all parameters for a single site. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{parameter}: Measurement type (function requires "Depth" parameter to be present)
\item \code{DT_join}: Character timestamp used for joining
\item \code{mean}: The calculated mean value of measurements
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, but with the \code{flag}
column updated to include "sonde unsubmerged" for all parameters when depth
readings indicate the sonde was not fully underwater.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags water quality measurements collected when the monitoring
sonde was not fully submerged in water. This function uses depth sensor readings
to determine submersion status and applies flags across all parameters measured
at the same time. The data will be flagged if the value in the \code{relative_depth}
column is less than or equal to 0.
