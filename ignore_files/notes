Places to update file uploads and downloads to parquet files:

1. Defining folder paths for `CFC_curated_file_path`.
2. The `pwqn_data.RDS` file, that also needs to get renamed appropriately.
4. When saving the mWater data, which needs to get renamed properly as well.
5. The sensor specific seasonal thresholds need to be saved as a parquet file and renamed properly.
6. `final_historical_bind` object needs to be saved as parquet and renamed properly.
7. yaml credential files

3. Files saved in `api_puller()` function, that also need to get renamed appropriately.
